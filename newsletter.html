                    Harvard to Pay 'Unprecedented' Endowment Tax
                </div>
                <div class="teaser">
                    Harvard will likely pay tens of millions annually in added federal taxes after congressional Republicans passed a $1.5 trillion tax bill Wednesday that included a tax on returns from large university endowments.
                    University President Drew G. Faust called the new endowment tax "unprecedented" in an emailed statement to The Crimson Wednesday, adding it will constrain the University's finances and limit its capacity to fund certain programs.

                        In 1988, my twenty-six-year-old father jumped off a train in the middle of Hungary with nothing but the clothes on his back. For the next two years, he fled an oppressive Romanian Communist regime that would kill him if they ever laid hands on him again.
